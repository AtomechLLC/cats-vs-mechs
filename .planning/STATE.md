# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-26)

**Core value:** A student builds two factions that look nothing alike and discovers they can still be balanced — and discovers it by playing, not by being told a number.
**Current focus:** Phase 02.1 — token-authoring-inserted

## Current Position

Phase: 02.1 (token-authoring-inserted) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 6
Status: Executing Phase 02.1
Last activity: 2026-08-28 -- Phase 02.1 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Five converged Phase-1 architecture decisions are treated as near-binding — single `commit()` mutation funnel, integers-only JSON-clonable state split into `build`/`fight`/`ui`, two-tier render, snapshot undo, `alive` as a flag separate from `hp`.
- [Roadmap]: Two ordering rules honored — steppers ship in the same phase as roster add/remove (Phase 2); serialization comes after roster editing settles the build shape (Phase 4).
- [Roadmap]: PROJ-05, REF-03 and SHARE-07 pulled into Phase 5 because their observable behaviour requires the fight view to exist.
- [Roadmap]: FIGHT-11 is a scheduled playtest activity (plan 05-03), gating Phase 5 — not a code-review item.
- [Research]: Sharing is a compact build code, not a `file://` URL (leaks the student's home directory path, useless to recipients, not linkified by Discord).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **The no-verdict constraint (PROJ-06) is the most likely accidental scope violation in the project.** Every phase that touches the projection carries an explicit no-verdict success criterion. Watch for it re-entering as a colour, a bar, or a word.
- **Single file, parallel plans.** All code lands in one HTML file. Plans inside a phase must own disjoint named sections (`data / model / state / serialize / ops / render / interactions / boot / selftest`) or run sequentially.
- **Phase 4 needs a cross-browser test matrix**, not a smoke test — clipboard, encoding and hash failures are all silent.
